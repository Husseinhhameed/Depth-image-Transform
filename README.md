# Image and Depth Image Transformation Toolkit

Welcome to the Image and Depth Image Transformation Toolkit repository, a Python-based project developed to perform advanced image processing techniques on both standard and depth images. This toolkit applies methods like HOG, Normal Surface computation, and CLAHE to enhance image quality and extract meaningful features for further analysis.

## Features

- **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)**: Extracts feature descriptors by evaluating the direction and intensity of edges.
- **Normal Surface Computation**: Calculates the normal vectors for surfaces within depth images to assist in object recognition and scene understanding.
- **Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)**: Improves the contrast of images while avoiding noise amplification common in standard histogram equalization techniques.

## Built With

- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (optional for displaying images)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your machine. You will also need to install several Python libraries which can be done via pip.
